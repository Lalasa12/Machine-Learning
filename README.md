What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning is the subset(part) of artificial intelligence which allows us systems learn from data,identifying the patterns,make the decisions without being explicit programmatically.
Why we need ML?
We need ML because in real life problems are very complex,changing frequently so we did not write rules for everything it is very difficult. So ml enables the system to learn from the data and identifying its patterns automatically.

Examples:

1)Netflix recommendation movies.

2)House Price Prediction.

3)Email Spam Detection.
